a : Multistage Pumps
b : descriptionb
The MMB CDL / CDLF Series represents the cutting edge of vertical multistage technology, engineered specifically for applications demanding constant high pressure and unwavering reliability. The distinct vertical inline design significantly simplifies piping layouts and optimizes floor space usage, making it an ideal solution where space is at a premium.

Built for continuous duty in rigorous industrial environments, these pumps are available with a variety of material constructions to suit specific fluid handling requirements. They are coupled with Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled (TEFC) motors, available in standard and premium efficiency classes, ensuring long-term operational stability and energy savings.

Designed for versatility, the MMB 8" series is available in three-phase configurations and is engineered to perform in both standard and high-temperature environments. The robust internal construction features precision bush and thrust bearings capable of withstanding maximum axial and radial thrust loads up to 45500N. All mounting dimensions are manufactured in strict accordance with *NEMA standards* to ensure universal compatibility.
