a : Multistage Pumps
b : descriptionb
The MMB GMVB Series are robust multi-stage centrifugal pumps engineered for high-pressure fluid handling. Designed with a sectional casing architecture, these pumps are optimized for pumping clear to slightly turbid liquids free from abrasives.

The construction features statically and dynamically balanced closed impellers, ensuring vibration-free performance. The interstage casings are precision-sealed with O-rings and secured by external tie bolts for maximum structural integrity. Driven by IEC-standard motors, the GM/GMVB series offers exceptional reliability for demanding environments ranging from mining to power generation

d:  Key Features
* Robust Construction: Sectional casing design with external tie bolts. Standard cast iron pumps utilize cast steel casings for higher pressure requirements.

* Optimized Axial Balancing:

   -Standard: Axial balance secured by back wearing ring and balancing hole system.

   -High Head (>200m): Equipped with a balancing disc or balancing drum for superior load management.

* Flexible Installation: Suction and discharge flanges can be rotated in 90° increments on sizes 32, 40, 50, and 65 to suit complex piping layouts.

* Versatile Sealing Options: Available with Uncooled Single (S1) or Double (S2) stuffing box packing, or Mechanical Seals in accordance with DIN24960.

* Rigorous Quality Control: Each unit is hydrostatically tested at 1.5 times the closed-valve pressure and performance-tested before shipment.

* Specialized Fire Service Design: Multi-discharge port configuration available upon request for fire sprinkler systems.

* Reliable Bearing System: Grease-lubricated ball bearings provided as standard, with an oil lubrication option available.

e: Applications
Engineered to perform in critical infrastructure and industrial sectors:

* Water Supply: Municipal and industrial water supply installations.

* Power & Utility: Boiler feed, circulating, and condensing plants.

* Pressure Boosting: High-pressure booster systems.

* Heavy Industry: Mining operations and power supply plants.

* Fire Safety: Sprinkling installations and fire service systems.
