The MMB 10-inch "10TB Series" motors are heavy-duty, rewindable submersible drives designed for deep borehole applications where reliability and high power output are paramount. Pre-filled with water to serve as an eco-friendly coolant and effective lubricant, these motors ensure sustainable, high-performance operation.

Available in three-phase configurations, the MMB 10" series is engineered to perform seamlessly in both standard and high-temperature environments. The internal mechanical structure is reinforced with precision bush and thrust bearings, specifically designed to withstand maximum axial and radial thrust loads up to 60,000N. All mounting dimensions are manufactured in strict compliance with NEMA and International standards, ensuring universal compatibility.
