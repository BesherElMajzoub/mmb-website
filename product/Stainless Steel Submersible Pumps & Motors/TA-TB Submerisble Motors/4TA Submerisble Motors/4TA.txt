MMB TA\TB Series Submersible Motors
The MMB "TA Series" motors are precision-engineered, rewindable submersible motors designed for deep boreholes. Pre-filled with water, which serves as both an eco-friendly coolant and a lubricant, these motors ensure reliable and sustainable operation.

Available in both single-phase and three-phase configurations, the series is built for durability. The rotor is supported by high-grade bush and thrust bearings capable of withstanding maximum axial and radial thrust loads. The single-phase models come equipped with built-in thermal protection to prevent overheating. All mounting dimensions are manufactured in strict accordance with NEMA standards, ensuring universal compatibility.c : 

d:  Key Features
* Optimized Electrical Efficiency: Designed to deliver maximum output with reduced energy consumption.
* Rewindable Stator Design: Allows for easy maintenance and repair, extending the lifecycle of the motor.
* Eco-Friendly Lubrication: Water-filled design ensures efficient cooling and lubrication without environmental risk.
* Robust Bearing System: Extremely hardwearing, water-lubricated bearings engineered to handle high axial loads.
* Integrated Protection: Single-phase motors feature built-in thermal overload protection.
* Durable Construction: Corrosion-resistant stainless steel body for long-term reliability.
* Serviceability: Engineered structure allows for easy dismantling and repair.

e: Applications
* Domestic & Civil: Residential water supply and building services.
* Agriculture: Irrigation and sprinkler systems.
* Landscape: Gardens and fountains.
