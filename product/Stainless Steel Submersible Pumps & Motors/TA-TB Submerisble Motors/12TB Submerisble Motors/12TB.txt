Maximum Power for Large-Scale Industrial & Mining Projects

Product Description:
The MMB 12-inch "TB Series" motors are the giants of our submersible drive range, specifically engineered for ultra-deep wells and high-capacity borehole applications. These rewindable motors are pre-filled with water, utilizing it as an eco-friendly coolant and lubricant to ensure thermal stability under heavy loads.

Designed for industrial resilience, the 12" series is available in three-phase configurations and is capable of operating efficiently in both standard and high-temperature environments. The internal engineering features robust bush and thrust bearings, calculated to withstand massive axial and radial thrust loads up to 60,000N. All mounting dimensions are constructed in strict accordance with *International standards*, ensuring compatibility with high-capacity pumps globally.

d:  Key Features
* High-Efficiency Power Drive: Precision-wound to deliver maximum torque and efficiency for large-scale operations.
* Serviceable Architecture: Fully rewindable stator design allows for cost-effective repairs and extended asset life.
* Corrosion-Resistant Body: Motor housing constructed from high-grade stainless steel for longevity.
* Eco-Friendly Lubrication: Water-lubricated system eliminates oil contamination risks while ensuring effective cooling.
* Heavy-Duty Bearing System: Extremely hardwearing bearings engineered to support significant thrust loads.
* Thermal Versatility: Special design options available for hot water applications up to 50˚C.
* Ease of Maintenance: Designed for straightforward dismantling and repair to minimize operational downtime.

e: Applications
