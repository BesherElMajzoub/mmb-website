a : Submersible Motors
b : descriptionb
The MMB 6-inch "TA Series" motors are robust, rewindable submersible drives designed for deep borehole applications. Pre-filled with water to function as an eco-friendly coolant and lubricant, these motors are engineered for superior thermal management and operational stability.

Available exclusively in three-phase configurations, the series is versatile enough to handle both normal and high-temperature environments. The internal architecture features high-load bush and thrust bearings, precision-engineered to withstand significant axial and radial thrust loads. All mounting dimensions are manufactured in strict compliance with NEMA standards, ensuring seamless integration with standard pump ends.

d:  Key Features
* High-Efficiency Operation: Engineered to maximize power transfer while minimizing energy loss.
* Dual-Temperature Capability: Special design variants available for hot water applications (up to 50˚C).
* Rewindable Stator: Service-friendly design allows for rewinding, extending the motor's total operational life.
* Eco-Friendly Lubrication: Water-lubricated system ensures effective cooling without environmental risks.
* Heavy-Duty Bearing System: Extremely hardwearing bearings designed to handle high thrust loads.
* Corrosion Protection: Motor body constructed from corrosion-resistant stainless steel.
* Ease of Maintenance: Designed to be easily dismantled and repaired to reduce downtime.


e: Applications
** Industrial & Mining: Heavy-duty water supply and de-watering systems.
* Agriculture: Pivot irrigation systems, sprinkler networks, and livestock watering.
* Commercial Buildings: Pressure boosting and general water supply.
* Safety: Fire-fighting systems.
