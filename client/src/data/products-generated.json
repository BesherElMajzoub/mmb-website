Available in single or multistage configurations, these pumps utilize advanced mixed-flow impellers to achieve maximum hydraulic efficiency.\n\nBuilt entirely from premium, corrosion-resistant stainless steel, the MMB 10\" series ensures exceptional durability and longevity. The structural integrity is reinforced by radial bearings at each casing stage, ensuring precise shaft alignment and vibration-free operation under heavy loads. To optimize performance, precision-engineered wear rings are fitted on both the impeller and casing to maintain tight clearances, thereby maximizing efficiency and minimizing wear. A robust built-in check valve is included to prevent backflow and protect the system against water hammer. All mounting dimensions comply strictly with *NEMA and International standards*.",
